\# Binary Operations Visualizer for BNN Research



Demonstrates XNOR and popcount operations used in Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) vs traditional MAC operations.



\## Features

\- Compare traditional MAC with XNOR-popcount operations

\- Visualize binarization and binary operations

\- Calculate power and area efficiency metrics

\- Educational tool for understanding BNN accelerators



\## Quick Start



```bash
